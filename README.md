Hey,
Today 20-06-2025 I have just completed my first my webdev project, which is basically a clone of a edtech website. I give it name "StudySync"
Now, it don't working as an actual website it has just HTML ans CSS Code only
Now, i am learning JavaScript, Once i will learn how javascript adds logic to the website/webpages i will definately complete my this project with proper responsiveness
till then i am learning JavaScript and webdev in depth.
